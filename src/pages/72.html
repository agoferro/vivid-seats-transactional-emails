<h4>%firstName%,<br>
    This is where it gets fun! It’s time to accept your %eventName% tickets.</h4>


<p>
    <strong>Simply follow the easy steps below to successfully accept the transfer of your tickets:</strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Accept Transfer via Email.</strong> - You should have received a transfer notification email from the
        event or team stating that your tickets have
        been transferred to you. You'll need to login or create a new account under the email address <strong>(%customerEmail%)</strong>
        you provided to us. You may be asked to enter additional information before you are able to accept your tickets
        — be sure to follow these prompts carefully!<br>
        <strong>Please note: Don’t delay. Accept the transfer as soon as possible. You’ll need to accept your tickets
            prior to the start of the event. Once accepted, your tickets may not be visible, but they will display once
            accessed on a mobile device.</strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Download the App (if necessary)</strong> - If specified in the email notification from step 1, you may
        be required to access and display your tickets through a specific app. If so, please download the app to your
        mobile phone. If no app is specified, you will be able to display your tickets through the mobile browser on
        your smartphone by logging into the account you created in step 1.
    </li>
    <li><strong>View Your Tickets Before You Go</strong> - There will be no shortage of energy and excitement at the
        event. That means thousands of people sending photos and posting to social from the stadium. Access your tickets
        before you head out, so you avoid the cellular logjam and any connectivity issues. We're just looking out for
        you!
    </li>
